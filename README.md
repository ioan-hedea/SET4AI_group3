A suggested (and commonly used) layout — actual folders/files may vary:

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks with experiments, visualisations and narrative.
- `src/` — Python package / helper modules (reusable code used by notebooks).
- `data/` — Data directory (raw/processed). NOTE: large or sensitive files may be kept out of repo.
- `reports/` — Figures, PDF reports and presentation materials.
- `tests/` — Unit and integration tests (pytest).
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for pip.
- `environment.yml` — Conda environment (optional).
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` — repository metadata.
